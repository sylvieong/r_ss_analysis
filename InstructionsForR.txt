discrepancies between codebook and data file:
2) Counts supplied in this codebook are based on the complete address based, web and community samples combined unless otherwise noted. To help assure confidentiality 57 Nunavut voluntary community survey responses and were removed from the PUMF. To help assure data quality nineteen web-panel respondents from Ontario that were outliers were removed from the PUMF. Counts supplied in this codebook include the above 76 (57+19) respondents. Thus, the codebook counts will be slightly higher than counts produced from the PUMF.
